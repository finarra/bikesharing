# NYC Citibike Analysis
## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze and gain an insight on how the Citibike bikesharing bussiness works in New York City, in order to gain critical information that can boost the chances of succes of a similar bussiness in Des Moines.

## Results
After analyzing the data using Tableau visulaizations, the following resulst were achieved:

The total number of rides in August was 2, 344, 224 rides.

In this map the most popular locations for starting a trip are shown.
It should be noted that there are very popular starting locations in midtown Manhattan and at the south end of Central Park, which are very popular tourist locations, however, there is a fair share of trips starting Downtown at the Financial Centers.

As it is shown, the two peak hours for the whole day are at 8:00 am, where we can safely assume that NYC residents use the bikes to get to their workplaces, and between 5:00 and 7:00 pm, which are both popular tourist times, and the time that residents get off work and use the bikes to go home, or to take commuting transport to their final destinations.

After 9:00 am and up until early at night, there is a steady use of the bikes. The preferred time to do repairs would be between mdnight and 5:00 am.

Following the previous slide, if we analyse the peak hours throughout a week, there is a change in pattern use when we compare working days with the weekend. During weekends there is heavy usage between 10 am and 8 pm.

It can be noted that the number of male riders is significantly greater than the female riders, but with no significant difference in usage hours.

When analyzing the usage by weekday, dividing by gender and by user type, it can be noted that most of the trips are made by subscribers, with a greater share of male riders vs. female riders. At the weekends there is a slight increase in single customer rides, which can be attributed to visitors from out of town.

Most rides have a duration of less than 20 minutes, and almost all of them are less than 50 minutes. This is very logical for this type of transportation, for longer rides (that can be considered longer distances) there are more convenient means of transportation.

The predominance of male riders is consistent, with also slightly longer trips for males than for females.

As it is evident, bikesharing services are a very popular mode of transportation in densely populated areas such as NYC (mainly Manhattan), with several thousands of rides per hour.
It can also be a popular transportation for tourists who wish to enjoy the city without going out of budget.
There are three very strong and consistent indicators of who chooses this alternative of transportation, and how they use it:
1. A predominance in male riders is definite, and most of them are subscription users, who can be assumed to be Manhattan residents.
2. The peak hours are when offices open and close during workdays, significantly surpasing rides at other times. The pattern of rides changes radically during weekends.
3. Most rides are 30 minutes or less. Longer rides mean larger distances, which are not as suitable for a bike ride.

In this particular case, in Manhattan, the top starting locations for rides are both at areas with offices and tourist attractions, such as midtown or downtown Manhattan, where popular spots are located (eg. Empire State Building and corporate offices, World Trade Center memorial and the new financial centers). So although other locations have smaller number of rides in this particular analysis, it must be taken into account for starting this business in a different city, where tourist destinations may not be as near as workplaces. This is specially important when designating the bike stations distribution.
